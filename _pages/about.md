I am an Associate Research Professor and Biostatistician at [Duke School of Nursing](https://nursing.duke.edu/). I received my PhD in Biostatistics from University of California, Los Angeles. My statistical expertise is longitudinal data analysis and time-to-event data analysis. As a biostatistician, I have extensive experience collaborating with researchers in different therapeutic areas, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and mental health. My current research interests are advanced latent variable models that are widely used in symptom cluster research and intensive longitudinal data analysis that arise from mobile health research.
