There is an emerging need to use these intensively collected data to support patients with chronic illnesses in managing their conditions between clinic visit. This study introduces functional principal component analysis (fPCA) as a valuable tool for analyzing intensive longitudinal data (ILD) collected by mobile health devices, with a focus on chronic disease monitoring, risk prediction, and prevention. The study demonstrates fPCA's ability to abstract trends in irregular and sparse self-measured blood glucose data and predict crucial health outcome, HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. The results show that 61% of the variation in HbA1c could be predicted by blood glucose measures from the preceding three months. The findings highlight the potential of fPCA to enhance prediction accuracy and assess dynamic relationships between repeated health measures and outcomes in mobile health research.<img width="468" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d053b29-d9ec-46f0-a779-73051eb784e0" />
