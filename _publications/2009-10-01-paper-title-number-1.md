This paper develops digital phenotypes of patientâ€™s self-monitoring behavior based on their engagement with multiple mobile health devices by using latent class trajectory analysis. Distinct self-monitoring behavior groups were identified and individual demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with different self-monitoring behavior groups. This information provides crucial information for us to develop tailored support for people with T2DM so they can better monitor and manage their condition.
